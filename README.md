## Short Description
A protocol that allows for the creation of stablecoins pegged to USD, addressing challenges faced by emerging markets in accessing fiat currency.

## Description
Stablecoins have revolutionized the world of DeFi by being pegged to fiat currency, such as USDC (termed UsdStable). However, emerging markets face unique challenges, including limited access to USD, which often leads to a "black market" rate for UsdStable, creating a premium for USD access. The solution to this problem is the Vault Access Reserved Quota Network (VARQN).

**VARQN** is a network of decentralized applications (DApps) designed to issue, stabilize, and ensure liquidity for DevStable (a local stable coin) and UsdStable, effectively separating official rates from black market rates. Here's how it works:

**VARP (Vault Access Reserve Protocol):**
- Users deposit UsdStable (e.g., USDC or DAI), which allows them to mint DevStable and VART (a 1:1 USD pegged token).

**Automated Market Maker (AMM):**
- VART and DevStable are paired within the AMM for "price premium" discovery.
- The AMM also supports KYC/AML vetted stables or Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

### How it's Made
VARQNet is built using the following technologies and components:

1. **Architecture:**
   - Distributed Ledger: Operates on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain for transparency, immutability, and decentralization.
   - Smart Contracts: Self-executing contracts that govern interactions, including the minting of DevStable and VART, deposit of UsdStable, and AMM operations.

2. **Vault Access Reserve Protocol (VARP):**
   - Deposit Mechanism: Users send UsdStable to a specific smart contract address, verifying the deposit and minting DevStable and VART tokens.
   - Minting Algorithm: Ensures a 1:1 peg for DevStable and VART.
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Users can redeem their UsdStable by sending VART to the smart contract.

3. **Automated Market Maker (AMM):**
   - Liquidity Pools: Smart contracts that hold pairs of tokens, enabling trading and liquidity provision.
   - Price Discovery: Determines the "price premium" based on the ratio of VART to DevStable in the liquidity pool.
   - Integration: AMM is integrated with VARP for seamless liquidity provision and token minting/burning.

## The Problem
Emerging markets face difficulties in going "on-chain" due to:
- Regulatory uncertainties
- Negative perceptions
- Outright bans
- Low liquidity in fiat-to-crypto markets

## The Solution
VARQNet offers a protocol resistant to capital flight and open to capital attraction. Leveraging DeFi, it:
- Protects currencies against capital flight
- Attracts foreign direct investment
- Reduces transaction costs and incentivizes remittances

## What We Do
We incentivize cross-border remittances through highly liquid and seamless DeFi primitives and aim to expand to more real-world assets as we grow beyond remittances.

## We're Building for the Caribbean First
With a total addressable market of over $200 billion in the Caribbean, we aim to connect the U.S. to emerging markets through various means, including card payments, mobile money, cash kiosks, and bank transfers.

## Onboarding the Next Billion
With a global total addressable market exceeding $1 trillion, our goal is to extend our services to a broader range of emerging markets.
